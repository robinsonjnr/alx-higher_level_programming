"""
   a Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.
     City class:
         inherits from Base (imported from model_state)
         links to the MySQL table cities
         class attribute id that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer,
         can’t be null and is a primary key
         class attribute name that represents a column of a string of 128 characters and can’t be null
         class attribute state_id that represents a column of an integer, can’t be null
         and is a foreign key to states.id
     You must use the module SQLAlchemy

 Next, write a script 14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py that prints all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_14_usa:

     Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
     You must use the module SQLAlchemy
     You must import State and Base from model_state - from model_state import Base, State
     Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
     Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
     Results must be display as they are in the example below (<state name>: (<city id>) <city name>)
     Your code should not be executed when imported
